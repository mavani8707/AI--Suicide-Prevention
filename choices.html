AI is a powerful tool for suicide prevention.Its use in this field is a significant development in suicide risk assessment (Lejeune et Al, 2022) because of its integration of multimodal data, including social media, smartphones and wearables and medical records, thereby offering more accurate and reliable assessment than with present methods (Atmakuru et Al, 2025). This means that AI’s ability of analyzing large sets of data outweigh the human’s one.But when it comes to its implementation, it is crucial to tackle it responsibly. First, we need to address the acceptance of the public to use AI in suicide prevention: when it comes to human lives and technology, general consent and ethical implications are of utmost importance.  
</p>
      <p>
To support this statement, we can have a look at some research carried out in our neighbour country, Australia, in 2024. The study reveals the attitude of the public towards the use of AI in suicide prevention. It shows us that there are two ethical principles that mostly concern the population: the principle of respect and the principle of beneficence (C. Hardy et al, 2024).In medical healthcare, the principle of respect implies that it is an obligation to obtain informed consent from patients before doing things to try to help them; medical confidentiality and to not deceive patients (Gillon, 1994).The principle of beneficence implies to protect and defend the rights of others, to prevent harm from occurring to others, to remove conditions that will cause harm to others, to help persons with disabilities and to rescue persons in danger (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019, p.219).Moreover, in the survey conducted in Australia in 2024, the researchers conclude that, to ensure the principle of respect, the most important points are:  the safety of vulnerable individuals in the development of algorithms, the way the research is conducted, and the subsequent implementation of interventions. 
</p>

      <p>
The two principles of respect and beneficence, and the results of this survey support our vision of the implementation of this technology in this field. Though ethical implications regarding privacy and non-profitable attitudes are at the centre of the discussion of its implementation.In alignment with the principle of beneficence, we support an inclusive use of AI in suicide prevention.Indeed, we can find several studies discussing the roles of culture and power embedded in AI systems and the necessity for an inclusive dialogue between stakeholders in AI development (Shakir et al, 2020), the clinical safety and bias in this kind of use of AI (Challen et al, 2019), even the racial bias in algorithms (Lee, 2018). 
</p>
      <p>
All things considered, the key points for future implementations of AI in suicide prevention include: privacy, the methods to incorporate these practices, and inclusivity and diversity. We find enough evidence and therefore reason to conclude that the use of AI in this field needs broad trust from all stakeholders. The acceptance of AI in the context of suicide prevention by majority of the population is crucial, as we can confirm in several investigations such as the report “Trust In AI, Australian insights” by Australian population, conducted by the University of Queensland in collaboration with KPMG Australia (Guillespie et al, 2020).
